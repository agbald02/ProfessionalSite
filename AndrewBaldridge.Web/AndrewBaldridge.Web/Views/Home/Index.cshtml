                    I am an I.T. Professional located in Louisville, Kentucky. Currently employed at ZirMed, I am an I.T. Intern within their Architecture
                    department specifically working on internal web apps that are created primarily for monitoring and optimization purposes. As an entreprenuer I
                    am involved in the entrepreneurial community as well as a startup in the hunting industry. As a sports fan and avid outdoorsman, you can usually
                    find me on a mountain bike trail on the weekends, playing hockey during the week, and as of recently in a tree stand on Saturday mornings
                    looking for my friend Mr. Whitetail Deer.

                    js is a server side scripting language from Javascript for use of application building.
                    It is event driven and uses non-blocking in order to have the greatest optimization ability. It operates
                    using Google’s V8, operates on a single thread, and uses event loops and package management.
