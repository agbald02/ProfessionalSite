                    As an entreprenuer I am involved in a startup in the hunting industry as

                    A sports fan and avid 
                    outdoorsman, you can usually find me on a mountain bike trail on the
                    weekends, playing hockey during the week, and as of recently in a 
                    tree stand on Saturday mornings looking for my friend Mr. Whitetail Deer.
